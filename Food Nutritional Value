FIND dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utsavdey1410/food-nutrition-dataset 

This file uses dataset from u/utsavdey1410 at Kaggle and provides detailed nutritional values for various types of foods and food items. It provides extensive macro and micronutrient details for each food listed.
The purpose of this file is to demonstrate and showcase my skills in SQL to isolate data, analyze, and answer potential questions that a user of this dataset could have.



--Display entire table:
SELECT * FROM food_dataset;

--Display complete list of foods sorted from the highest caloric value:
SELECT food, MAX(caloric_value) AS caloric_value
  FROM food_dataset 
  GROUP BY food, caloric_value
  ORDER BY caloric_value DESC;

--Isolate one food and display all nutritional value (food name can be replaced when using the same query):
SELECT * FROM food_dataset WHERE food='tortilla';

--Display foods listed that are oils with its complete nutrional values sorted by lowest caloric value:
SELECT * FROM food_dataset
  WHERE food LIKE '%oil'
  ORDER BY caloric_value;

--Display top 10 foods with the highest Monounsaturated fats:
SELECT food, monounsaturated_fats FROM food_dataset
  ORDER BY Monounsaturated_fats DESC
  LIMIT 10;

--Display foods with Monounsaturated fat greater than 7:
SELECT food, monounsaturated_fats FROM food_dataset
  WHERE Monounsaturated_fats>7
  ORDER BY Monounsaturated_fats DESC;

--Display number of foods that have zero carbohydrates:
SELECT COUNT(food), carbohydrates
  FROM food_dataset
  WHERE carbohydrates=0
  GROUP BY carbohydrates;

--Based on this table, a dietician has a patient that is allergic to potatoes. The query below displays the table exluding potatoes:
SELECT * FROM food_dataset
  WHERE food NOT LIKE '%potato%' OR '%potatoes%';

--The dietician wants to present a list of foods to the same patient that exlcudes potatoes and is sorted by foods with the highest protein. The query below lists 20 foods with the highest protein and excludes potatoes:
SELECT * FROM food_dataset
  WHERE food NOT LIKE '%potato%' OR '%potatoes%'
  ORDER BY protein DESC
  LIMIT 20;

--A user needs to know the caloric intake of an arepa with avocado oil. The query below shows the total caloric value shown as 'total_calories':
SELECT SUM(caloric_value) AS total_calories
  FROM food_dataset
  WHERE food='arepa' OR 'avocado oil';
