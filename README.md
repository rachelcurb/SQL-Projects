## Welcome to my SQL Projects! ##

This page contains projects that help to showcase my skills in SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a programming language that is used to store, maintain, and manipulate information in a database. It can be particularly useful when needing to extract and analyze information in large databases. Companies commonly use SQL as an important tool for data analytics.

For these projects, I chose MySQL as the main relational database management system to demonstrate my knowledge of commands and queries.
